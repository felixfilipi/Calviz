# Calviz
Calviz is an abbreviation of Calculus Visualizer which is used as visualizing tool for various calculations of math expressions. Calviz built on C++ to provide high-performance calculation speed in order to give the best user experience for massive analysis of the polynomial expression.



# Features
* Calculation in Graph Visualization.
* Derivative Expression & Result.
* Interval calculation each Result.
* Root Squared Interval.
* High performance calculation.



# Running Application.
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Go to the release directory.
3. `./Calviz` (Tested on Linux only).



# Interface and Example

* Get calculation and visualization to the second derivative.

# Constraint

Since the software still in beta, there're some limitations of it:

* Maximum Derivative 10 levels.
* Maximum Root Squared Derivative 10 levels.
* Separate x value by `,` (comma).



# Further Development

The software is going to be maintained until these feature completed:
* Integral.
* Limit.
* Fourier Transform.
* Any suggestions?? ask on issues.
